.SH NAME
tarlz \- creates tar archives with multimember lzip compression
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tarlz
\fI\,operation \/\fR[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tarlz is a massively parallel (multi\-threaded) combined implementation of
the tar archiver and the lzip compressor. Tarlz uses the compression library
lzlib.
.PP
Tarlz creates tar archives using a simplified and safer variant of the POSIX
pax format compressed in lzip format, keeping the alignment between tar
members and lzip members. The resulting multimember tar.lz archive is
backward compatible with standard tar tools like GNU tar, which treat it
like any other tar.lz archive. Tarlz can append files to the end of such
compressed archives.
.PP
Keeping the alignment between tar members and lzip members has two
advantages. It adds an indexed lzip layer on top of the tar archive, making
it possible to decode the archive safely in parallel. It also minimizes the
amount of data lost in case of corruption.
.PP
The tarlz file format is a safe POSIX\-style backup format. In case of
corruption, tarlz can extract all the undamaged members from the tar.lz
archive, skipping over the damaged members, just like the standard
(uncompressed) tar. Moreover, the option '\-\-keep\-damaged' can be used to
recover as much data as possible from each damaged member, and lziprecover
can be used to recover some of the damaged members.

Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems
(file not found, files differ, invalid command\-line options, I/O errors,
etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or invalid input file, 3 for an internal
consistency error (e.g., bug) which caused tarlz to panic.
