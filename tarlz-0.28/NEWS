Changes in version 0.28:

The new option '-T, --files-from', which tells tarlz to read the file names
from a file, has been added.

The new options '-R, --no-recursive' and '--recursive', have been added.

The new option '--depth', which tells tarlz to archive all entries in each
directory before archiving the directory itself, has been added.

The new options '--mount' and '--xdev', which tell tarlz to stay in the
local file system when creating an archive, have been added.

The new option '--parallel', which tells tarlz to use multithreading to
create an uncompressed archive in parallel if the number of threads is
greater than 1, has been added. This is not the default because it uses much
more memory than sequential creation.

The new debug operation '--time-bits', which makes tarlz print the size of
time_t in bits and exit, has been added.

The short option name '-?' has been assigned to '--help'.
