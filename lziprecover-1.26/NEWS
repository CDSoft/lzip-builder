Changes in version 1.26:

'--fec=create' can now process efficiently input files larger than RAM.
If the size of the input file is larger than half the system's RAM,
'--fec=create' now creates all the packets of the fec file concurrently to
avoid reading the input file more than once.

'--fec=repair' and '--fec=test' can now process input files larger than RAM.

'--fec=repair/test/list' now exit immediately with a diagnostic if the
protected file is passed by mistake as the fec file.

'--fec=repair' now inserts '_fixed' before '.tar' instead of after.

The new option '--append=<file>', which appends the contents of <file> as
trailing data to another file(s) in a safe way, has been added.

'-dvv' and '-tvv' now print (de)compressed sizes instead of compression
ratio. (Sizes are more informative than compression ratio).

Large numbers in option arguments are now accepted with underscore
separators (-b 123_456_789).

Large numbers are now printed with underscore separators (123_456_789).

'--list' now can safely skip any trailing data added to a lzip file by the
option '--append'.

'--list' now prints '+t' after the number of members to indicate the
presence of trailing data, and prints the size of the trailing data below
the size of the last member.

'-lvv' now prints a blank line between the list of members of each
multimember file and the next file.

Diagnostics for protected file size mismatch in '--fec=repair/test' have
been improved.

It has been documented in the manual how to append a fec recovery record to
a tar.lz archive, and how to use it to test and repair the archive.

'EXIT STATUS' now has its own section in the man page.
