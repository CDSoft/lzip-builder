Changes in version 0.29:

A bug has been fixed that prevented the detection of
'--mtime=1969-12-31T23:59:59' as an invalid date on some systems.
(Thanks to Michael Shigorin).

The new option '--numeric-owner', which tells tarlz to not write owner or
group names to the archive, has been added.

The extended keyword 'ctime' is now recognized.

Large numbers in option arguments are now accepted with underscore
separators (--mtime=@123_456_789).

'-f' now rejects archive names with control characters.

'make check' now skips the symbolic link archiving test on Cygwin.
(Reported by Sonia Diaz).

A table of SI and binary prefixes has been added to the manual.
